# ConsoleDapperProject

## Information

I used this project to combine a C# console application with Dapper to use SQL to interact with the SQL Server database. I experimented with dependancy injection and application services. This project also contains SQL change scripts which are used to create the database schema.

The console commands let the users manage companies and employees through CRUD commands.
